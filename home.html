                        Software & Technical has been a career mainstream involved with digital data systems in real time environments.

                        Coding is a hobby, proficient in C language programming and Matlab , previously did some Javascript to gaming level, some Java enough to find it simple using the Eclipse IDE. Currently using Apache IDE for HTML coding and now expanding into PHP programming and MySql, also working on d3 Javascript graphics and API access using Javascript, PHP and Python.
                        
                        Not at full developer level and not seeking developer positions. Thing with coding (at my level) I tend to bash at something full on for a few weeks 12 hours a day and never give up till I get it so I’m just not going to do that professionally, it’s not good for you, I’ve got some personal software projects and I’ll get there eventually.

                        Aged 61 now retired from mainstream career previously used to working long remote tours on location but now preferring to work remote at home.

                        <br/>
                        Essentially winding down from a somewhat energetic global career but seeking remote options to fill my time, I don’t mind repetitive since if it’s remote work I have my home.                   
                        <br/>
                        <br/> 
                        Attention to detail was the mainstay of my engineering career which honed observational and analytical skills.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I have a good understanding of science, technical and medical literatures as well as a lifetime of communication skills solving technical issues. This provides a well informed understanding of most subject matters which should assist the speed and quality of a transcription output.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        A built in ethic for high quality work, manually fairly snappy on a keyboard I can do 48 wpm for manual editing. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The role offers one the incentive to attain levels of self improvement. I would imagine there are some skills to be acquired and other skills and technical aspects to be uplifted to attain a productive and accurate output. 
                        
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Perhaps transcription on a production level a fairly repetitive process however I am thinking attentiveness to the audio content would provide focus and background interest to the tasks along with the incentive to provide a final quality output with regard to proof reading, punctuation and grammar.
