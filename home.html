                        Not yet at full software developer level nor currently seeking a software developer position ( However I am now racing to get there ) .

                        The recent AI work was a few weeks distraction , current aim for personal projects is to complete the web site builds (coding not wordpress) 
                        which should complete my web building knowledge then return and complete on d3 javascript graphics .
                        A few more scripts should also complete on Machine Learning and 
                        later this year once consolidated I will define the next software direction .

                        <br/>
                        A career requisite has always been absolute attention to detail .

                        <br/>
                        Repetitive data processing , I have had to do that at times within the earlier MWD/LWD framework . 
                        An occasional tool problem was the failure of a downhole memory data sync with surface data due to a data-time stamp error on the processor chip . The oil well formation memory data was at significantly higher resolution to real time data transmitted to surface .
                        Entailed manually inputting a date-time stamp in hexadecimal format onto the chip for every data point . (With a significant amount of surface data on record (weight on bit log , rate of penetration log , pumps pressure) there was a way to do this accurately as well as comparison to the real time data log ).
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        A second occasional repetitive data intense role within the MWD/LWD environment . On occasion the surface systems could not decode real time data while drilling if encountering high noise to signal ratio .
                        Entailed manually hand decoding real time signals (in hexadecimal format) into data , then manually inputting the data into computer systems for real time display to drilling rig floor and other locations . 
                        Not often but I have done that non stop every minute a 12 hour shift for days to keep the rig drilling to end of section . (On these occasions quality of hand decoded data was checked when memory data retrieved from tool).

                        <br/> 
                        Otherwise , although mainstreamed Science & Engineering my English Language skills , Technical Reporting , and general administration abilities are at high level . A requisite to working successfully for Oil companies at the point end for 23 years .
